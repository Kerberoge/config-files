This is a guide on how to enable low-power hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding on the iGPU of an Intel Pentium 4415U.

1. Copy i915/kbl_guc_70.1.1.bin and i915/kbl_huc_4.0.0.bin from linux-firmware to /lib/firmware
2. Add these two files to CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE
3. Add "i915.enable_guc=2" to kernel cmdline
4. Enable CONFIG_DRM_I915_DEBUG_GUC and CONFIG_DEBUG_FS to check whether it's working later on
5. Recompile & reboot
6. Check contents of /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_{guc,huc}_load_status or similar files to find out if GuC/HuC firmware was loaded successfully (see link 1 at bottom of page)

Additionally, you also need to install the Intel Media SDK. If you're on Void Linux, things get complicated since:
- There is no intel-media-sdk package, you have to create your own template file and compile it yourself. See
	https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86_64/intel-media-sdk.
- You also need to rebuild the intel-media-driver package with the nonfree flag enabled, since it is disabled by default.

To encode in low power mode, add "-low_power 1" to your ffmpeg command (link 2). The Render/3D utilization in intel_gpu_top should be really low and only Video should be high (last page of link 1).
